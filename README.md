## StashBlob

StashBlob is a cloud storage provider that gives users control over their own files to upload and share files faster.

## Upload

We allow you to upload files faster and easier. With our simple and fast upload stream, we give you a fast uploading experience throughout the app.

## Optimize

Optimization is built into images, which means every image you upload, we optimize them for you. So slightly blurry images would be optimized by 50-100%.

## Share

For every file you upload, we have the power to share them with your friends and beyond.
